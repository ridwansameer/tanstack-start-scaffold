# TanStack Start Scaffolded project

A very minimal project scaffold using TanStack start. Currently Start is in Alpha and the only way to project is to manually init a few files. Instead you can clone this repo and start using it straight away!

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
